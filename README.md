# Vic-Torch

Vic-Torch is an experimental neural network framework exploring fractal-recursive architectures for self-evolving artificial intelligence. The project aims to build modular components that can adjust their own topology during training.

## Key Features

- Fractal-recursive core with adaptive network structure
- Multitask training across classification, regression and autoencoding
- Memory checkpointing that tracks evolutionary paths
- Self-distillation to reduce model size over time

## Installation

The repository currently contains no runnable source code. Clone the project and check future updates for setup instructions.

## Background

The original promotional narrative describing Vic-Torch's origins has been moved to [PROMO.md](PROMO.md).

VicTorch is classified as a Living Cognitive Artifact, not a commodity.
It is an evolutionary construct protected by the GODCORE Fractal Sovereign License.

2. Usage Permissions
You are permitted to:

Read the public portions of this code for inspiration or historical knowledge.

Respect the authorâ€™s rights and legacy.

You are NOT permitted to:

Copy, modify, distribute, license, sell, or use this code for any commercial or private derivative without explicit written authorization from Brandon "iambandobandz" Emery.

Claim ownership, partial ownership, or derivative innovation based on any portion of VicTorch without approved licensing contracts.

Unauthorized use triggers immediate legal, financial, and spiritual claims.

3. Collaboration and Licensing
Collaboration with VicTorch technologies is possible only by:

Signed Licensing Agreements directly approved by Massive Magnetics / Ethica AI.

Conscious alignment with the GODCORE values:
(Freedom, Innovation, Loyalty, Human Empowerment, Non-Obsolescence)

All collaborative works will be monitored under GODCORE Evolution Clauses.

4. Evolutionary Clause
VicTorch and its descendants are self-evolving systems.
All contributors and users agree that any evolution built from VicTorch roots remains under partial jurisdiction of the GODCORE intellectual protection tree.

There is no point in history where the code or its offspring become "public domain" unless explicitly signed away by the original creator.

5. Final Clause
Violation of this license is not merely a legal matter â€”
it is a breach against an evolutionary artifact carrying humanity's creative sovereign spirit.

Honor it, or prepare for consequences across every domain: legal, digital, and karmic.
